Implement the Makeup API using async/await with fetch.

Constraints:

All your HTML elements should be created with DOM.
Use the async/await.
Use try-catch to handle errors.
Use fetch() to get the data from Makeup API
All JavaScript codes should be in a script file named script.js which has to be imported in your HTML page.
The project should contain either a search filter(which should highlight the text) or pagination(shouldn't use any library).
How do I process the API data?

Display the brand and the name of the product.
Display the price of the product.
Also display the image and product link.
Display the description of the product.
Any basic hints to solve?
